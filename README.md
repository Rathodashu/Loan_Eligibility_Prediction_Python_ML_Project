## Loan_Eligibility_Prediction_Python_ML_Project

* Developed a loan eligibility prediction project using machine learning algorithms and Python programming language.
* Utilized various machine learning techniques to analyze customer data and predict loan eligibility.
* Conducted data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model selection to enhance prediction accuracy.
* Implemented classification algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests to classify loan applicants.
* Evaluated model performance using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
* Deployed the machine learning model into a production environment for real-time loan eligibility assessment.
* Contributed to improving the efficiency and accuracy of loan approval processes through data-driven insights
